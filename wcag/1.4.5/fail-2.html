          To Arms! To Arms! Our country calls for aid, Of faithful sons an
          offering must be made. From every hamlet in the loyal North, Her
          sturdy yeomen in their strength go forth; Mechanics, merchants, all
          professions too, Give up the arts of peace, another to pursue.

        I have often been asked to narrate my experience in the War of the
        Rebellion, and have as often refused, but now after the lapse of thirty
        three years since the close of that fearful struggle between brother
        men, I feel that perhaps it would be well, for the satisfaction of those
        who so earnestly desire it, to “Fight my battles over again.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Mine was not an exceptional experience, only that of many a boy of ’61,
        but it may partly answer the question so often asked: “What did the
        privates do?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I have often wondered how it happened that I, born of quaker stock on my
        mother’s side (she was descended from the Kemptons, who were among the
        first settlers of our quaker city of New Bedford,) should have had such
        a natural leaning towards scenes of adventure and conflict. It may well
        have been that I inherited it from the paternal side of the house, for
        my father’s father, John James, was taken prisoner on board his ship
        during the War of 1812, and thrown into an English prison, and I have
        often, during my childhood, listened to his tales of warfare and
        bloodshed, and longed to be a man that I might fight and avenge the
        wrongs inflicted on my devoted country in its earlier days; and how I
        wished, as I read of the War of the Revolution, that I might have lived
        in those stirring days, and done my part in creating the American
        Nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly it did not seem possible that occasion would ever arise when I
        should be one of the defenders of that great nation.
