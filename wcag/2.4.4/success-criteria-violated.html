  <section aria-labelledby="wcag-failure-heading">
    <h2 id="wcag-failure-heading">Fails WCAG 2.4.4 (A)</h2>
    <p>Below is an example of a real-world failure, where identical non-descriptive link text appears multiple times and the surrounding context is not programmatically associated with the links (e.g., the first column is not marked up as a row header).</p>
    <table role="presentation">
        <tr>
          <td class="colhead">Resource</td>
          <td class="colhead">Description</td>
          <td class="colhead">Responsible Party</td>
          <td class="colhead">Full Details</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Budget Planning Guide</td>
          <td>Outlines forecasting methods and cost allocation strategy</td>
          <td>Finance Strategy Office</td>
          <td><a href="budget.html">Read more</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tax Compliance Overview</td>
          <td>Summarizes obligations for state and federal reporting</td>
          <td>Tax and Treasury</td>
          <td><a href="taxes.html">Read more</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Financial Aid Services</td>
          <td>Explains types of aid and eligibility criteria</td>
          <td>Student Financial Services</td>
          <td><a href="aid.html">Read more</a></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> These links do not meet WCAG 2.4.4 because a screen reader user navigating by links will hear multiple "Read more" links without any way to quickly distinguish between them. The context in the first column is not programmatically associated with the link text.</p>
  </section>

  <section aria-labelledby="linked-row-labels-heading">
    <h2 id="linked-row-labels-heading">Passes WCAG 2.4.4 and WCAG 2.4.9</h2>
    <p>In this version, the text of the resource name is a link, and it's located in the first column of each row. This approach improves clarity and avoids the need for separate generic link text. Because the purpose of each link can be understand by itself, this example meets both success criterion 2.4.4 <em>and</em> 2.4.9.</p>

      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Resource</th>

          <th scope="col">Responsible Party</th>

        </tr>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This version avoids repeated vague link text by using the resource name itself as the link, which is both descriptive and naturally integrated into the table structure.</p>

  <section aria-labelledby="corrected-table-heading">
    <h2 id="corrected-table-heading">Passes WCAG 2.4.4 but not WCAG 2.4.9</h2>
    <p>This version meets WCAG 2.4.4 by associating the topic with each link through proper use of row headers. Although the links still say "Read more," their purpose is clear when assistive technologies associate them with the first cell of each row.</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Resource</th>
          <th scope="col">Description</th>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This table passes WCAG 2.4.4 because the first column is marked with <code>scope="row"</code>, making it programmatically associated with the "Read more" links in the same row.</p>
